# Pre-Midterm

## Components of Language

### Lexicon

- things about language that must be memorized
- vocabulary
- idioms (kick the bucket, etc.)

### Phonology

- sounds combined into larger words

### Syntax

- words combined into larger units

### Semantics

- relate meaning of expressions to meaning of parts



## Design Features of Human Language

### Discreteness

- discrete units

### Productivity

- discrete infinity
- parts of messages can be used to create parts of new messages

### Recursion

- categories can contain themselves

### Duality of Patterning

- two layers of structure
- sounds -> words
- words -> sentences

### Arbitrariness of the Sign

- connection between sound and meaning is unpredictable
- exceptions
  - onomatopoeia
  - sound symbolism (kiki, buba)

### Displacement

- communicate about things not immediately present

### Reflexiveness

- use language to talk about language

### Cultural Learning

- acquisition from community






## Onomatopoeia

- words formed by association to a sound
  - woof
  - quack




## Sound Symbolism

- kiki and buba
- bang, fizz, slide, slippery




## Language Learning and Language Diversity Relationship






## Signed Languages

- not different from other language
  - hand gestures can count as phonemes
- same features as other human language
  - duality of patterning
  - arbitrariness of the sign
- ASL grammar distinct from English
  - verbal aspect
  - word order
  - classifiers




## Vocal Tract Anatomy

### Humans

- short tongue
- lower larynx
- easier to move tongue freely
- easier to choke

### Apes

- long tongue
- higher larynx





## Differences Between Humans and Animals

- in general
  - no true productivity
  - no discrete combinatorial system

### Bee Waggle Dance

- two continuous scales
  - duration
  - direction

### Ape Communication

- aggression
- submission

### Vervet Monkeys

- alarm calls specific to predators
- whole unit message
- no productivity
- only a lexicon

### Bird Song

- syrinx instead of larynx
  - vibrations in membrane of trachea
- learn song in stages
  1) subsong
  2) plastic song
  3) crystallized song
- made up of discrete units
  - A A B B A C
  - follow a few basic patterns





## Basic Results of Animal Learning Experiments

- rhesus monkeys and rats learn algebraic rules A B C A B C A B C
- tamarins, bengalese finches, pigeons and learn finite-state grammars
- humans and tamarins can learn regular grammars
- only humans can do context free

### Order of Complexity

1) Finite-State Grammars (algebraic patterns): rats, monkeys, tamarins, finches, pigeons
2) Regular Grammars: humans, tamarins
3) Context-Free Grammars: humans only





## Language Family

- descended from common ancestor speech community
- from a common proto-language
- English and German



## Cognates

- words that share common origin
- features shared due to common descent




## Proto-Languages

1) proto-indo-european
2) niger-congo
3) austronesian
4) trans-new-guinea
5) sino-tibetan
6) indo-european
7) afro-asiatic



## Comparative Method

- feature-by-feature comparison of two languages with common ancestor
- study language development



## Dialect Maps

- geographical distribution of language speakers
- isoglosses = marks the boundary between linguistic features





## The Canadian Shift

![](img/can-shift.png)

- Canadian shift moves "bet" low and "pat" back
- Nothern cities shift is the opposite, moves "bet" high and "pat" forward




## Connection Between Change and Variation

- change leads to variation
  - grammar 1 affects language 1
  - language 1 affects grammar 2
- over time we are changing our grammar
- divergence across areas where language is spoken



## Variations and Social Meaning

- Labov fourth floor department store study
  - variation between different social classes
  - upper class keeps r, middle class uses some r, lower class uses almost no r
  - upper and lower classes don't change much after the get older
  - middle class changes to imitate upper class as they get older (middle class crossover)





## Basic Features of AAVE

### Habitual Tense

- the "habitual be"
  - "be" doesn't carry the same meaning as standard english
- She be runnin'
  - She is often running

### Negative Concord

- also used in Italian
- double negative indicates a single negative
- "I ain't never gonna love you"

### Copula Absence

- absence of "is" "are" "am" "were" etc.
- She runnin'
  - She is running




## Register

- formal, informal
- phonological reduction is usually informal register
- flapping "tt" -> "dd"
- unstressed vowel deletion
- contractions


## The Nature of Perspective Rules

- one of the variants is prescribed
  - this is the "right" way to do it




## Gender Differences in Language Use

- women use more conservative variants of stable sociolinguistic variables
- girls use non-standard variables with peers
- boys use non-standard variables with interviewers



## Gender as a Factor in Linguistic Change

- women conform more to overtly prescribed variants
  - conform less to variants that are not overtly prescribed
- women are one generation ahead of men






## Basic Vocal Tract Anatomy

![](img/vocal-anatomy.png)






## Basic Ideas About Vowel Articulation and Acoustics

- front
- back
- high
- low
- resonance, acoustic performance
- tongue changes the shape of the vocal cavity
  - divides it in two





## Phoneme

- units of phonetics
- discrete units of sound



## Allophone

- the sounds that represent a single phoneme



## Minimal Pair

- pair words that differ by one sound







## Presupposition

- implicit assumption related to an utterance
- Jim no longer walks on the beach
  - the presupposition is that he used to walk on the beach




## Implicature

- something a speaker implies with an utterance without expressing
  - "The picture frame is nice"
  - the implication is I don't like the picture *inside the frame*




## Grice's Maxims

- speakers are good
- act in good faith during a conversation
- speakers are cooperative
- assume other speakers are cooperative
- quality, quantity, reverence





## Syntactic Bootstrapping

- duality of patterning -> syntax
- children are born with the innate ability to understand syntax



## Phonological Bootstrapping

- duality of patterning -> phonology
- children are born with the innate ability to understand phonology


## Word Segmentation

- probability of when two sounds are next to each other
- children can segment words easily
- recognize own name by 4.5 months



## Parental Feedback

- children don't need it to learn their native language
- Simon learned to speak ASL better than his parents
- Trackton, parents don't talk to their children before they can speak



## Assumptions (Constraints) Guiding Learning of Word Meaning

- whole object assumption
  - words refer to whole objects
- taxonomic assumption
  - words refer to things of the same kind
- mutual exclusivity
  - words have a 1 to 1 mapping with meaning
  - only for monolinguals








## Pidgin and Creole Characteristics

- pidgins
  - limited communication systems after contact
  - nobody's first language
  - small lexicon
  - unstructured, unsystematic
  - simple phonology, morphology

- creoles
  - full-fledged languages that develop from pidgins
  - native speakers
  - share some features with pidgins (simplicity of phonology and morphology)





## Difference Between Pidgins and Creoles

- native speakers
  - pidgin no, creole yes
- pidgin has smaller lexicon
- creole is more structured and systematic




## Superstrate/Lexifier vs Substrate

- socio-politically powerful language is superstrate or lexifier
- less powerful language is substrate
- English is the superstrate in Jamaican creole
- French is the superstrate in Hawaiian creole




## Language Bioprogram Hypothesis

- children faced with unstructured pidgins impose structure upon them
- universal human grammar
- this could be how pidgins become creoles




## Critical Period Hypothesis

- period in childhood when language acquisition is much easier
- adults start well, plateau quickly
- children start slowly and progress further
- could explain why pidgins never develop complexity, while creoles do




## Nicaraguan Sign Language

- creole sign language
- spontaneously emerging sign language in a new community
- children restructure input radically
  - give bias to certain grammatical structures and regularities





















# Post-Midterm

## Signed Languages (Basic Properties)

- distinct from languages around them
- all design features of human language
    - duality of patterning
- iconicity (an exception to arbitrariness of the sign)
- suprasegmental (stress, facial expression, etc.)
- pronouns by location

## Parameters in Sign Language Phonology

- at least one of these must change during the sign
- parameters
    - location
    - direction
    - handshape
    - non-manual markers
- assimilation -> signs taking on parameters of neighboring signs
    - this happens in spoken English too
- affixation
    - prefixes or suffixes

## Similarities and Differences Between Signed and Spoken Languages

### Similarities

#### Syntax

- spoken
    - word order changes for questions / passive form
- signed
    - SVO is typical word order
    - other word orders occur frequently as well

#### Phonology

- spoken
    - words combined through syntax
- signed
    - meaningless elements to meaningful parts
    - words are combined through syntax

#### Simultaneity of Features

- spoken
    - only one utterance at a time
- signed
    - still severe constraints on multiple things happening at once

### Differences

#### Suprasegmental

- spoken
    - pitch/timbre
- signed
    - facial expressions

#### Iconicity

- spoken
    - some iconicity in spoken language
    - fewer things that can be represented audibly than visually
- signed
    - signs bear visual similarity to messages

#### Discreteness

- spoken
    - 3 layers
    - features, sounds, words
- signed
    - 2 layers
    - features, words

## Natural vs Artificial Form in Poetry and Music

- both
    - rules are formally complex
    - acquired automatically
- natural
    - same sense as language
    - categories from elsewhere in language
    - rule types from elsewhere in language
    - stress, syllables, consonant vs vowel, iambic pentameter
- artificial
    - artificial rules
    - greater conscious control than grammar
    - can only be learned artificially
    - e.g., increase letter by one every line

## Textsetting, Sung Verse (Drunken Sailor)

- textsetting
    - syllables at regular intervals
    - regardless of what word you're on
    - AKA isochronic

### Drunken Sailor Song

- Halle and Lerdahl
    - figure out grammar of the song
    - ability to improvise implied there was a rule
- line up syllables to the beat of the song (textsetting)
- find stressed syllables and link to the strongest beats
- language stress and rhythm operate independently

## Meter, Metrical Template

- meter
    - recurring pattern of stresses or accents
    - provide a pulse / beat
- iambic pentameter
    - sequence of weak/strong beats = foot
    - 5 iambic feet
    - WS WS WS WS WS
- intuitive hypothesis
    - stressed -> strong
    - unstressed -> weak
    - only 6.8% of Shakespeare's sonnets comply
- open-classed words
    - stressed -> verbs, nouns, adjectives, adverbs
- closed-classed words
    - unstressed -> articles, general functioning words
- metrical template
    - grammatical representation of the meter
    - WSWSWS WSWSWS WSWSWS...

## Core English Metrical Constraint

- linguistic representation also has stressed and unstressed syllables
- perfect lines -> complete match between W and unstressed, S and stressed
    - most lines are not perfect
- the imperfect way of doing it:
    - S -> any syllable
    - W -> only unstressed syllables unless one syllable word
    - exception: the first W can be stressed for any word
- not identical to WSWSWS pattern but does not depart far

## Metrical Tension/Counterpoint

### Tension

- mismatch between weak/strong pattern of template and line
- produced through
    - gradual motion to higher or lower pitch
    - reiteration
    - increase in dynamic level
    - partial syncopations between consonance and dissonance

### Counterpoint

- mismatch between linguistic representation and metrical template
- harmonically dependent
- independent in rhythm and contour

## Structural Differences Between Sung and Written Verse

- sung verse -> generally not as strict
- written verse -> generally iambic pentameter

## Musical Grammar, Judgements

- experienced listeners can tell what's right and wrong
- grammatical judgements -> a speaker's judgement on how well-formed a string is
- musical grammatical judgement is called musical idiom

## Properties Shared by Music and Language

### Grouping / Constituency

- utterances have hierarchal grouping and structure
    - -> constituents can be inside other constituents

### Headedness

- noun phrase has a head
- musical strings have a head

### Rhythm

- regular alternation of strong and weak
- prosody -> patterns of rhythm and sound used in poetry

### Recursion

- organized into constituents
- constituents inside constituents
- grouping signaled through how it sounds (pitch, duration, intonation)

### Features Shared

1. Syntax
1. Phonology
1. Discreteness
1. Recursion

## Differences Between Musical and Linguistic Structure

- finite set of available pitches
    - continuous in language, discrete in music
- equivalence of pitches that differ by a multiple of 2
    - 110Hz, 220Hz, 440Hz, 880Hz = A
    - possible linguistic parallel? phoneme corresponds to multiple sounds... but this is weak
- tonality -> "home key" as the central tone of a piece
    - other pitches have tension/instability
- musical idioms
    - conventional sequences build and resolve tension
- simultaneity
    - in language you mostly can't do two things at once
    - suprasegmental stuff, yes
    - but you can't say two things at once

## Sapir-Whorf Hypothesis

- language shapes thought
- the way you speak determines the way you think (strong form)
    - not a strong contender
- the way you speak *influences* the way you think (weak form)
    - this is a more realistic contender
- language is merely a part of culture (weakest form)
    - this is obviously *at least* true, but the above may be true as well

## Studies Investigating Language and Culture

### Language and Color

- colors within category are harder to perceive differences than colors across categories
    - e.g., two shades of red vs red and orange
    - this is true even when distance on the spectrum is the same
- tested English and Russian speakers
    - in English, one category for blue
    - in Russian, two categories for blue
    - other color used as a control
    - Russian speakers very slightly better at distinguishing
- two possibilities:
    1. Russian speakers are using different perceptual systems
    1. subjects are using language to think about color
- give a simultaneous linguistic task to make language unavailable for the color task
    - difference disappears
    - possibility 2 is the winner

### Language and Time

- next Wednesdays meeting has been moved forward two days
    - is it on Monday?
    - is it on Friday?
    - how do you position yourself relative to time
- do you perceive yourself:
    - moving forward through time?
    - time moving forward around you?
- spacial primes
    - related tasks prime people to answer one way or the other
    - people who had been standing in line for long time were more likely to say Friday
    - people who had just flown (perceived themselves as moving) answer Friday
- the fact that this can change (based on priming) goes against SWH
- Borodistky (2001)
    - Mandarin and English native speakers
    - Mandarin -> vertical time concept
    - English -> horizontal time concept
    - exposed to primer images
    - vertical bias greater for those who started learning English later in life

### Language and Space

- studied Guugu Yimidhiir and English
    - English -> relative
    - Guugu Yimidhiir -> absolute
- Levinson (1997)
    - do Guugu Yimidhiir retain relative or absolute positions in memory
    - speakers use language to encode memory
    - so, yes, there was a difference between English and Guugu Yimidhiir

## Causes of Language Endangerment and Loss

### Endangerment

- colonial interactions
- missionary activity, cultural disruption
- economic disruption
- geographic disruption
- educational policy
    - residential schools
- lack of official recognition

### Loss

- almost no record of it
- last native speaker dies
- no longer widely used
- speakers shift to different languages

## Factors in Language Vitality

1. speaker population
1. ethnic population
1. trends in population size

- **unequal** bilingualism
- attitude, prestige (substrate languages)
- official recognition
- how children are learning it

## Goals of Language Documentation

- work with endangered language communities
- work to benefit communities **and** scholars
- listen to what communities want
- Gleason (1961)
    - ideally, alphabetic system has a one-to-one correspondence between phonemes and graphemes
    - not always the case or possible
- Rehg (2004)
    - system should be designed by ideal linguist using ideal theory in ideal language in ideal society
- dictionary making

## Common Ethical Issues with Field Linguistics

- stages of attitude development
    1. benefit only researcher
    1. consider consequences of research
    1. change attitude to benefit community as well
- elicitation
- stories
- experiments

### Problems With Traditional Elicitation

- artificial, culturally alien setting
- who decides what is "correct"
- data can violate privacy
- language can have spiritual value, not shared with outsiders
- Ken Hale talked about this
    - language research inevitably affects larger socio-cultural environment
    - responsible for mitigating this effect

### Solutions?

- work from first principles
- too complex to study everything at once
- language study is not a purely scientific activity
    - it is cultural, social, political
    - it has cultural, social, political consequences

## The Prepositional Model

1. research on speakers vs with speakers
1. research for linguists vs for speakers
1. research by linguists vs by speakers **and** linguists
